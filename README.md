# Cozy Pad
*A cozy and wholesome macro pad for design folk*

Made by Sam Daitzman and Dieter Brehm

## Project proposal
Our goal is to create and program a tiny keyboard to make frequent tasks or
shortcuts easier to access on a computer. It will have eight keys in a 4 column,
2 row grid, and will connect over usb to a computer. The computer will dictate
the key-binding through its operating system, but the keypad firmware will
bridge the gap between the key switches and the computer's USB keyboard spec.

Details about the project and what we want to learn from it are in our [proposal
document](reports/proposal.md). A pdf of the same proposal is [here](reports/proposal.pdf).

You can see our [final report](reports/report.md) to learn about the current status of this project.
